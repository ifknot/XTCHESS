a bitboard (bb) is 64 bits 8 bytes 4 words
a move bb is colour agnostic
64 move bbs for one piece each board position is 8 x 64 = 512 bytes
6 piece types 6 x 512 = 3072 - ie only 3K of memory

bottom left square A1 ie white side is LSB of the bb
top right square H8 ie black side is MSB of bb

TODO:
[x] bit count
[x] ternary count (0, 1, many)
[x] position extract
[ ] inverse bb

King on A1 ie LSB of the bb valid moves are B1, B2, A2 the bb hex would be
